BattleChain is an incentivized pre-mainnet environment where protocols can stress test their smart contracts with real funds before deploying to production.

## Get Started

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Deploy Your First Contract" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart/deploy-first-contract">
    Protocol? Start here.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Execute Your First Attack" icon="crosshairs" href="/quickstart/execute-first-attack">
    Whitehat? Start here.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Your First Request" icon="clipboard-check" href="/quickstart/review-first-request">
    DAO member? Start here.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

```
Deploy → Request Attack Mode → DAO Approves → Stress Test → Promote to Production
```

1. Protocol deploys contracts via `BattleChainDeployer`
2. Protocol creates a Safe Harbor agreement defining bounty terms
3. Protocol requests attack mode via `AttackRegistry`
4. DAO reviews and approves the request
5. Whitehats attack the contracts legally
6. Protocol promotes to production when confident
