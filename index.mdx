description: "The pre-mainnet stress testing environment for smart contracts"
---

BattleChain is an incentivized pre-mainnet environment where protocols can stress test their smart contracts with real funds before deploying to production.

## The Problem

- There's no real staging environment in Web3
- Projects go from $0 to $5M TVL overnight after audit
- Bug bounties are difficult for ethical hackers
- The industry keeps losing billions to preventable exploits

## The Solution

BattleChain provides a controlled environment where:

- **Protocols** deploy audited contracts with real liquidity for stress testing
- **Whitehats** legally attack contracts marked as "attackable" and earn bounties
- **The DAO** moderates the process, approving attack requests and preventing copycat exploits

## How It Works

```
Deploy → Request Attack Mode → DAO Approves → Stress Test → Promote to Production
```

1. Protocol deploys contracts via `BattleChainDeployer`
2. Protocol creates a Safe Harbor agreement defining bounty terms
3. Protocol requests attack mode via `AttackRegistry`
4. DAO reviews and approves the request
5. Whitehats attack the contracts legally
6. Protocol promotes to production when confident
