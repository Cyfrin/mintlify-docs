description: "Understanding Anonymous, Pseudonymous, and Named identity options"

Safe Harbor agreements can specify identity requirements for whitehats. These range from fully anonymous to requiring legal name verification.

## Identity Requirement Levels

```solidity
enum IdentityRequirements {
    Anonymous,     // No identity verification
    Pseudonymous,  // Consistent pseudonym required
    Named          // Legal name verification required
}
```

## Anonymous

**No identity verification required.**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What It Means" icon="user-secret">
    - Attack from any address
    - No identity disclosure needed
    - No KYC process
    - Full privacy preserved
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best For" icon="check">
    - Privacy-conscious whitehats
    - Quick attacks without coordination
    - Lower-value bounties
    - Protocols wanting maximum participation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Checking for Anonymous

```solidity
BountyTerms memory terms = agreement.getBountyTerms();
if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Anonymous) {
    // You can remain fully anonymous
}
```

## Pseudonymous

**You must provide a consistent pseudonym, but not your real identity.**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What It Means" icon="mask">
    - Use a consistent username/handle
    - Build reputation under that name
    - No legal name required
    - Contact through pseudonymous channels
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best For" icon="check">
    - Building whitehat reputation
    - Medium-value bounties
    - Ongoing relationships with protocols
    - Accountability without full exposure
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How to Comply

1. Choose a consistent pseudonym (e.g., "whitehat_alice")
2. Use the same name when contacting the protocol
3. Optionally link to reputation (GitHub, Twitter, past bounties)
4. Be reachable through pseudonymous contact methods

### Example Contact

```
From: whitehat_alice
Telegram: @whitehat_alice
GitHub: github.com/whitehat-alice

I successfully exploited the XYZ vulnerability in your vault contract.
Recovered: 500 ETH
Bounty retained: 50 ETH (10%)
Sent to recovery: 450 ETH
TX: 0x123...

Please confirm receipt.
```

## Named

**You must verify your legal name through a specified process.**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What It Means" icon="id-card">
    - Legal name verification required
    - May involve KYC provider
    - Documentation needed
    - Less privacy, more trust
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best For" icon="check">
    - High-value bounties
    - Regulatory-compliant protocols
    - Enterprise/institutional protocols
    - Whitehats comfortable with identity disclosure
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Diligence Requirements

For Named identity, check the `diligenceRequirements` field:

```solidity
BountyTerms memory terms = agreement.getBountyTerms();

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Named) {
    string memory requirements = terms.diligenceRequirements;
    // May contain instructions like:
    // "Complete KYC through Persona: https://verify.persona.co/..."
    // "Submit government ID and proof of address to security@protocol.com"
    // "Sign agreement via DocuSign: https://..."
}
```

### Common KYC Processes

| Method | What's Needed |
|--------|---------------|
| ID Verification Service | Government ID, selfie, proof of address |
| Video Call | Live verification with protocol team |
| Legal Agreement | Sign NDA or bounty agreement |
| Third-Party KYC | Use a service like Persona, Jumio, etc. |

### Privacy Considerations

<Warning>
Before completing KYC:

- Understand what data is collected
- Know who has access to your information
- Consider jurisdictional implications
- Evaluate if the bounty is worth the disclosure
</Warning>

## Choosing Which Contracts to Attack

Filter targets based on your identity comfort level:

```solidity
// Get bounty terms
BountyTerms memory terms = agreement.getBountyTerms();

// Check identity requirement
if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Named) {
    // Requires legal name - skip if not comfortable
    return;
}

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Pseudonymous) {
    // Need to provide a pseudonym
    // Acceptable if you have an established identity
}

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Anonymous) {
    // No identity requirements - proceed freely
}
```

## Identity and Bounty Amount

Generally, higher identity requirements correlate with higher bounties:

| Identity Requirement | Typical Bounty Cap |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Anonymous | $100K - $1M |
| Pseudonymous | $500K - $5M |
| Named | $1M - $10M+ |

Protocols requiring identity verification often:
- Have larger TVL
- Are more established
- Have regulatory requirements
- Offer larger bounties

## After Providing Identity

Once you've verified your identity:

1. **Maintain records**: Keep copies of what you submitted
2. **Monitor for misuse**: Ensure your data isn't shared inappropriately
3. **Update if needed**: Some protocols require periodic re-verification
4. **Consider reputation building**: Named whitehats can build public track records
