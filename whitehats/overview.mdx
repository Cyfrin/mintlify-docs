---

BattleChain provides whitehats with a unique opportunity to legally attack smart contracts and earn bounties. All contracts in "attack mode" are covered by Safe Harbor agreements that protect you from legal liability.

## Why BattleChain?

### Legal Protection

Unlike traditional bug bounties where you report vulnerabilities, BattleChain lets you actually exploit them. The Safe Harbor agreement provides legal protection for:

- Executing exploits on contracts in attack mode
- Extracting funds from vulnerable contracts
- Keeping a bounty percentage of recovered funds

### Real Rewards

Contracts on BattleChain have real funds. Successful exploits earn you real bounties, not just reputation points.

### Clear Rules

Each contract has a published Safe Harbor agreement defining:
- Bounty percentage and caps
- Asset recovery address
- Identity requirements
- Contracts in scope

## The Whitehat Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Targets">
    Query the `AttackRegistry` for contracts in `UNDER_ATTACK` state
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Terms">
    Check the Safe Harbor agreement for bounty terms and scope
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Attack">
    Exploit vulnerabilities in contracts within scope
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Funds">
    Send recovered funds to the asset recovery address, keeping your bounty
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comply with Requirements">
    Meet any identity requirements specified in the agreement
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Protected

  <Card title="Protected Actions" icon="shield-check">
    - Exploiting contracts in `UNDER_ATTACK` state
    - Extracting funds from vulnerable contracts
    - Keeping bounty up to the specified cap
    - Acting without prior coordination
  </Card>
  <Card title="Not Protected" icon="shield-xmark">
    - Attacking contracts in `PRODUCTION` state
    - Attacking contracts outside the agreement's scope
    - Keeping more than your bounty entitlement
    - Ignoring identity requirements
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Check

Before attacking any contract:

```solidity
// 1. Check if the contract is attackable
bool isAttackable = attackRegistry.isTopLevelContractUnderAttack(targetContract);

// 2. Get the agreement address
address agreement = attackRegistry.getAgreementForContract(targetContract);

// 3. Check bounty terms
BountyTerms memory terms = IAgreement(agreement).getBountyTerms();

// 4. Verify contract is in scope
bool inScope = IAgreement(agreement).isContractInScope(targetContract);
```

## Important Considerations

<Warning>
**Due Diligence Required**

Before exploiting a vulnerability, verify that:
- The same vulnerability doesn't exist on mainnet
- You're not exposing a zero-day that could harm other protocols
- The contract is genuinely in attack mode (not a scam)
</Warning>

<Note>
If you discover a vulnerability that also exists on mainnet, consider using a traditional bug bounty platform instead. Publicly exploiting it on BattleChain could tip off malicious actors.
