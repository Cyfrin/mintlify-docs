## Registry Moderator

The address that can approve/reject requests and instant promote.

```solidity
// Get current moderator
address moderator = attackRegistry.getRegistryModerator();

// Change moderator (owner only)
attackRegistry.changeRegistryModerator(newModerator);
```

## Valid Chains

CAIP-2 chain IDs that can be used in agreements.

```solidity
// Check if chain is valid
bool valid = safeHarborRegistry.isChainValid("eip155:1");

// Set chains as valid (owner only)
safeHarborRegistry.setValidChains(chainIds);

// Set chains as invalid (owner only)
safeHarborRegistry.setInvalidChains(chainIds);
```

### Common Chain IDs

| Chain | CAIP-2 ID |
|-------|-----------|
| Ethereum Mainnet | `eip155:1` |
| Arbitrum One | `eip155:42161` |
| Optimism | `eip155:10` |
| Base | `eip155:8453` |
| BattleChain Testnet | `eip155:325` |
| BattleChain Mainnet | `eip155:326` |

## Time Constants

Set at deployment (require upgrade to change):

```solidity
uint256 public constant PROMOTION_WINDOW = 14 days;
uint256 public constant PROMOTION_DELAY = 3 days;
uint256 public constant MIN_COMMITMENT = 7 days;
```

| Constant | Value | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `PROMOTION_WINDOW` | 14 days | Auto-promote if DAO inactive |
| `PROMOTION_DELAY` | 3 days | Delay after `promote()` |
| `MIN_COMMITMENT` | 7 days | Minimum agreement commitment |

## Agreement Factory

Creates and validates agreements.

```solidity
// Get factory
address factory = safeHarborRegistry.getAgreementFactory();

// Set factory (owner only)
safeHarborRegistry.setAgreementFactory(newFactory);

// Check if agreement is valid
bool valid = agreementFactory.isAgreementContract(agreementAddress);
```

## Safe Harbor Registry

Links protocols to agreements.

```solidity
// Get registry
address registry = attackRegistry.getSafeHarborRegistry();

// Set registry (owner only)
attackRegistry.setSafeHarborRegistry(newRegistry);
```

## BattleChain Deployer

Registers new deployments.

```solidity
// Get deployer
address deployer = attackRegistry.getBattleChainDeployer();

// Set deployer (owner only)
attackRegistry.setBattleChainDeployer(newDeployer);
```

## Contract Upgrades

Both `AttackRegistry` and `AgreementFactory` use UUPS upgradeable pattern:

```solidity
// Owner can authorize upgrades
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner;
```
