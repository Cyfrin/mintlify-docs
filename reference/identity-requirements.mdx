## Identity Enum

```solidity
enum IdentityRequirements {
    Anonymous,     // 0
    Pseudonymous,  // 1
    Named          // 2
}
```

## Levels

### Anonymous (0)

No identity verification required.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Verification | None |
| Privacy | Full |
| Typical Bounty Cap | $100K - $1M |
| Best For | Maximum participation |

### Pseudonymous (1)

Consistent pseudonym required.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Verification | Provide consistent username/handle |
| Privacy | Real identity protected |
| Typical Bounty Cap | $500K - $5M |
| Best For | Building reputation while private |

**How to comply:**
- Choose a consistent pseudonym
- Use same name in all protocol communications
- Optionally link to reputation (GitHub, Twitter)

### Named (2)

Legal name verification required.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Verification | Legal name confirmed via specified process |
| Privacy | Identity disclosed to protocol |
| Typical Bounty Cap | $1M - $10M+ |
| Best For | High-value bounties, regulated protocols |

**How to comply:**
- Check `diligenceRequirements` field
- Complete specified KYC process
- May involve ID verification, video call, legal agreement

## Checking Requirements

```solidity
BountyTerms memory terms = agreement.getBountyTerms();

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Anonymous) {
    // No verification needed
}

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Pseudonymous) {
    // Provide consistent pseudonym
}

if (terms.identity == IdentityRequirements.Named) {
    // Check diligenceRequirements
    string memory requirements = terms.diligenceRequirements;
    // Complete specified process
}
```

## Filtering by Comfort Level

```solidity
// Only attack contracts matching your privacy preference
if (uint8(terms.identity) <= maxIdentityLevel) {
    // Acceptable identity requirement
}
```

## Strictness During Commitment

Identity requirements cannot become stricter during the commitment window:

```
Anonymous < Pseudonymous < Named
```

A change from `Anonymous` to `Pseudonymous` during commitment would revert.
