## For Protocols

### Deploy Identical Code

Deploy the exact same bytecode you'll use on mainnet. Only differ in:
- Constructor parameters (addresses, chain IDs)
- Configuration values that legitimately differ per-chain

```solidity
// Good: Same contract, different config
new MyVault(battleChainOracle, chainSpecificFee);

// Bad: Different code for BattleChain
new MyVaultTestVersion();  // Don't do this
```

### Start with Reasonable Liquidity

Deploy enough to attract whitehats, but not more than you're comfortable losing:

| Protocol Type | Suggested Liquidity |
|--------------|---------------------|
| DEX/AMM | \$50K - \$200K |
| Lending | \$100K - \$500K |
| Yield Aggregator | \$50K - \$150K |
| NFT/Gaming | \$10K - \$50K |

### Complete Audit First

BattleChain is for stress testing, not finding obvious bugs:

```
Audit → BattleChain → Mainnet
```

### Set Competitive Bounty Terms

Attract whitehats with reasonable terms:
- 10% bounty (industry standard)
- $5M cap (attractive for serious researchers)
- `retainable = true` (easier for whitehats)
- `Anonymous` identity (lower barrier)

### Plan Testing Duration

| Risk Level | Minimum Attack Period |
|------------|----------------------|
| Low (simple) | 1-2 weeks |
| Medium (DeFi primitives) | 2-4 weeks |
| High (complex DeFi) | 4-8 weeks |

## For Whitehats

### Verify Before Attacking

Always check:
1. Contract is in attackable state
2. Contract is in agreement scope
3. Agreement is valid (from official factory)
4. You understand the bounty terms

### Handle Funds Correctly

Follow the agreement terms exactly:
- Calculate bounty properly
- Send correct amount to recovery address
- Document everything

### Consider Mainnet Implications

If your exploit works on mainnet too:
- Don't publicly disclose
- Contact the protocol privately
- Consider traditional bug bounty

### Keep Records

Document:
- Target contract and agreement
- Vulnerability details
- Transaction hashes
- Bounty calculations
- Funds sent to recovery

## For the DAO

### Review Thoroughly

Check every request for:
- Mainnet copycats (most important)
- Valid deployment method
- Reasonable bounty terms
- Clear scope definition

### Act Promptly

- Approve/reject within days, not weeks
- Remember: 14-day auto-promotion if no action
- Reject to reset clock if more time needed

### Document Decisions

Record:
- What was reviewed
- Checks performed
- Decision rationale
- Any concerns

### Use Instant Promotion Sparingly

Only for genuine emergencies:
- Copycat discovered on mainnet
- Unexpected TVL surge
- Protocol emergency request
