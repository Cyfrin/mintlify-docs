## The Problem

Web3 has a fundamental gap in its development lifecycle. Traditional software has well-established staging environments where code is tested with production-like conditions. Web3 lacks this:

| Traditional | Web3 Today | With BattleChain |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Dev → Staging → Production | Dev → Testnet → Mainnet | Dev → Testnet → **BattleChain** → Mainnet |
| Staging has real-like data | Testnet has fake money | BattleChain has real funds |
| Issues found before users | Issues found after millions at risk | Issues found with controlled risk |

The consequences:
- Projects go from \$0 to \$5M TVL overnight after audit
- Bug bounties don't attract serious testing (report vulnerabilities, don't exploit them)
- The industry loses billions to preventable exploits

## The Solution

BattleChain is a **pre-mainnet, post-testnet environment** with real funds. It's an incentivized testnet where:

- **Protocols** deploy audited contracts with real liquidity
- **Whitehats** legally attack contracts and earn bounties
- **The DAO** moderates to prevent abuse

## How It Works

Every contract on BattleChain exists in one of two modes:

### Attack Mode

Open season for ethical hacking:
- Whitehats can legally exploit vulnerabilities
- Safe Harbor agreement protects attackers
- Bounties paid for successful exploits
- Protocol learns about vulnerabilities before mainnet

### Production Mode

Protected like mainnet:
- No Safe Harbor protection for attacks
- Same security expectations as mainnet
- Regular bug bounty rules apply

## The Flow

```
Deploy → Request Attack Mode → DAO Approves → Stress Test → Promote to Production
```

1. Protocol deploys via `BattleChainDeployer`
2. Protocol creates Safe Harbor agreement with bounty terms
3. Protocol requests attack mode
4. DAO reviews and approves (ensures not a mainnet copycat)
5. Whitehats attack during the stress test period
6. Protocol promotes to production when confident

## Why an L2?

BattleChain runs as a ZKSync-based L2:

1. **Isolation**: Attacks don't affect mainnet liquidity
2. **Branding**: Clear distinction as experimental environment
3. **Protocol-level tracking**: Contract states tracked at chain level
4. **Efficiency**: Lower costs for deployment and testing

## Who Should Use BattleChain?

**Everyone.** Whether you're:

- Launching a new protocol
- Adding features to an existing protocol
- Testing experimental DeFi mechanisms
- Stress testing AI trading bots

BattleChain provides safe validation with real economic incentives.
