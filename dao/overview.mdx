---

The BattleChain DAO serves as the registry moderator, responsible for approving attack requests, preventing abuse, and maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem.

## The DAO's Role

The DAO acts as the **registry moderator** for the `AttackRegistry`. This role has significant responsibilities:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Approve Attack Requests" icon="check-circle">
    Review and approve legitimate protocols requesting attack mode
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reject Copycats" icon="ban">
    Prevent mainnet mirrors from entering attack mode
  </Card>
  <Card title="Emergency Promotion" icon="bolt">
    Instantly promote contracts when necessary
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Govern chain validity and other parameters
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why DAO Moderation?

### Preventing Copycat Attacks

Without moderation, malicious actors could:
1. Deploy a contract identical to a mainnet protocol
2. Enter attack mode
3. Have whitehats find vulnerabilities
4. Use those vulnerabilities to attack mainnet

The DAO reviews requests to ensure contracts are genuinely new, not copies of existing mainnet protocols.

### Protecting the Ecosystem

The DAO ensures:
- Only legitimate protocols use BattleChain
- Attack mode isn't abused for malicious purposes
- The Safe Harbor system maintains credibility

## Registry Moderator Powers

The registry moderator (DAO) can:

```solidity
// Approve an attack request
function approveAttack(address agreementAddress) external;

// Reject an attack request
function rejectAttackRequest(address agreementAddress) external;

// Instantly promote to production (emergency)
function instantPromote(address agreementAddress) external;
```

Additionally, the DAO (through governance) controls:

```solidity
// Set which chains are valid for agreements
function setValidChains(string[] calldata caip2ChainIds) external;

// Mark chains as invalid
function setInvalidChains(string[] calldata caip2ChainIds) external;
```

## DAO Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Events">
    Watch for `AgreementStateChanged` events with `ATTACK_REQUESTED` state
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Request">
    Verify the protocol is legitimate and not a mainnet copycat
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve or Reject">
    Call `approveAttack()` or `rejectAttackRequest()` based on review
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor for Issues">
    Watch for copycat situations requiring emergency action
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Timeline Constraints

| Scenario | Timeline |
|----------|----------|
| DAO reviews and approves | Request → `UNDER_ATTACK` immediately |
| DAO reviews and rejects | Request → `NOT_DEPLOYED` immediately |
| DAO takes no action | Request → `PRODUCTION` after 14 days |

<Note>
The 14-day auto-promotion is a safety mechanism. If the DAO is inactive, contracts default to production (protected) rather than remaining attackable indefinitely.
