description: "A step-by-step tutorial for DAO members to review and approve attack requests"
---

This tutorial walks you through reviewing an attack mode request as a DAO member. By the end, you'll understand how to evaluate requests and approve or reject them.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: You must be the registry moderator or part of the DAO multisig.
</Note>

## What You'll Do

1. Find pending requests
2. Review the protocol and contracts
3. Check for copycat contracts
4. Approve or reject the request

## Step 1: Monitor for New Requests

Watch for `AgreementStateChanged` events with `ATTACK_REQUESTED` state:

```solidity
event AgreementStateChanged(address indexed agreementAddress, ContractState newState);

// newState = 2 means ATTACK_REQUESTED - needs review
```

Or query directly:

```solidity
IAttackRegistry.ContractState state = attackRegistry.getAgreementState(agreementAddress);

if (state == IAttackRegistry.ContractState.ATTACK_REQUESTED) {
    // This agreement needs review
}
```

## Step 2: Get Agreement Details

Fetch the agreement information:

```solidity
// Get the agreement contract
IAgreement agreement = IAgreement(agreementAddress);

// Get full details
AgreementDetails memory details = agreement.getDetails();

string memory protocolName = details.protocolName;
BountyTerms memory terms = details.bountyTerms;
Contact[] memory contacts = details.contactDetails;
```

Check the contracts in scope:

```solidity
// Get all contracts covered by this agreement
address[] memory contracts = agreement.getBattleChainScopeAddresses();

// Check how each was deployed
for (uint i = 0; i < contracts.length; i++) {
    address deployer = attackRegistry.getContractDeployer(contracts[i]);

    if (deployer == address(0)) {
        // NOT deployed via BattleChainDeployer
        // Requires extra scrutiny
    } else {
        // Deployed via BattleChainDeployer
        // Has on-chain proof
    }
}
```

<Check>
You now have all the information needed to evaluate the request.
</Check>

## Step 3: Review Checklist

Go through this checklist:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Is this a legitimate new deployment?">
    - Was it deployed via BattleChainDeployer?
    - Does the protocol have a web presence, social accounts, audit reports?
    - Are the contact details valid?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Is it NOT a mainnet copycat?">
    **This is the most important check.**

    - Compare bytecode to known mainnet contracts
    - Search for similar protocol names on other chains
    - Check if the same contracts exist elsewhere with TVL
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Are bounty terms reasonable?">
    - Is the bounty percentage in normal range (5-15%)?
    - Is the cap appropriate for the expected TVL?
    - Are identity requirements clear?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Is the scope clearly defined?">
    - Are all necessary contracts included?
    - Is the child contract scope appropriate?
    - Is the recovery address a secure multisig?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 4: Make Your Decision

### If Everything Looks Good: Approve

```solidity
// Approve the attack request
attackRegistry.approveAttack(agreementAddress);
```

This:
- Changes state to `UNDER_ATTACK`
- Enables Safe Harbor protection
- Allows whitehats to attack

### If There Are Issues: Reject

```solidity
// Reject the attack request
attackRegistry.rejectAttackRequest(agreementAddress);
```

This:
- Returns state to `NOT_DEPLOYED`
- Clears contract mappings
- Protocol can resubmit with fixes

<Check>
You've completed your first review! The protocol will see the state change via events.
</Check>

## Step 5: Document Your Decision

Record:
- Agreement address reviewed
- Contracts in scope
- Checks performed
- Decision rationale
- Any concerns noted

## Red Flags to Watch For

<Warning>
Reject or investigate further if you see:

- **Bytecode matches mainnet contracts**
- **Protocol name mimics known protocol**
- **No verifiable contact information**
- **Extremely high bounty percentages (>25%)**
- **Request via non-authorized path with no explanation**
</Warning>
