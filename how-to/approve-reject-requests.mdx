## Overview

As the registry moderator, you review attack requests and decide whether to approve or reject them.

## Approve a Request

If the request passes review:

```solidity
attackRegistry.approveAttack(agreementAddress);
```

Effects:
- State changes to `UNDER_ATTACK`
- Safe Harbor protection begins
- Whitehats can attack

## Reject a Request

If the request fails review:

```solidity
attackRegistry.rejectAttackRequest(agreementAddress);
```

Effects:
- State returns to `NOT_DEPLOYED`
- Contract mappings cleared
- Protocol can resubmit with fixes

## Review Checklist

Before deciding, verify:

1. **Deployment method**: Deployed via BattleChainDeployer?
2. **Not a copycat**: Bytecode doesn't match mainnet contracts
3. **Legitimate protocol**: Has web presence, audit reports, valid contacts
4. **Reasonable terms**: Bounty percentage in normal range (5-15%)
5. **Clear scope**: All contracts properly defined

## Check Deployment Method

```solidity
address[] memory contracts = agreement.getBattleChainScopeAddresses();

for (uint i = 0; i < contracts.length; i++) {
    address deployer = attackRegistry.getContractDeployer(contracts[i]);

    if (deployer == address(0)) {
        // NOT via BattleChainDeployer - extra scrutiny needed
    }
}
```

## Timing

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Clear approval | Approve immediately |
| Clear rejection | Reject with feedback |
| Needs investigation | Decide before 14-day deadline |
| Approaching deadline, uncertain | Reject to reset clock |

<Note>
If no action is taken within 14 days, the agreement auto-promotes to `PRODUCTION`.
</Note>

## Batch Processing

Process multiple requests efficiently:

```solidity
function batchProcess(
    address[] calldata toApprove,
    address[] calldata toReject
) external {
    for (uint i = 0; i < toApprove.length; i++) {
        attackRegistry.approveAttack(toApprove[i]);
    }
    for (uint i = 0; i < toReject.length; i++) {
        attackRegistry.rejectAttackRequest(toReject[i]);
    }
}
```
