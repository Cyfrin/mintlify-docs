title: "How to Use Instant Promotion"
description: "Emergency promotion for copycat or high-risk situations"
---

## Overview

The DAO can instantly promote contracts to production, bypassing the 3-day delay. This is an emergency power for protecting the ecosystem.

<Warning>
Use instant promotion only for genuine emergencies.
</Warning>

## When to Use

### Copycat Discovery

A mainnet contract mirrors an attackable BattleChain contract:

1. Whitehat finds vulnerability on BattleChain
2. Someone deploys identical contract to mainnet
3. Mainnet contract is now vulnerable
4. **Action**: Instant promote to stop further disclosure

### TVL Surge

Unexpected liquidity growth creates unreasonable risk:

1. Protocol deployed with \$100K TVL
2. TVL grows to \$10M unexpectedly
3. Risk/reward ratio changes dramatically
4. **Action**: Consider instant promotion if protocol requests

### Protocol Emergency

Protocol discovers critical issue and needs to exit attack mode:

1. Protocol finds vulnerability themselves
2. Need to patch without whitehats exploiting
3. **Action**: Instant promote to protect users

## Execute Instant Promotion

```solidity
attackRegistry.instantPromote(agreementAddress);
```

Valid from these states:
- `ATTACK_REQUESTED` → skips attack phase entirely
- `UNDER_ATTACK` → ends attack immediately
- `PROMOTION_REQUESTED` → bypasses 3-day delay

## Effects

- State immediately becomes `PRODUCTION`
- Safe Harbor protection ends
- Contracts are no longer attackable

## Communication Template

Document and communicate the action:

```
EMERGENCY INSTANT PROMOTION

Previous State: UNDER_ATTACK
New State: PRODUCTION

Reason: [Copycat detected / TVL surge / Protocol emergency]
