description: "Why protocols should use BattleChain for stress testing"
---

BattleChain provides protocols with a unique opportunity to stress test their smart contracts with real economic incentives before deploying to mainnet.

## Why Use BattleChain?

### Real-World Stress Testing

Testnets don't attract serious security researchers because there's no financial incentive. BattleChain changes this by using real funds, attracting:

- Professional whitehats
- AI security bots
- Bug bounty hunters
- Security researchers

### Legal Clarity

The Safe Harbor agreement provides clear legal protection for whitehats attacking your contracts. This encourages more aggressive testing that might not happen with traditional bug bounties.

### Controlled Risk

- You control how much liquidity to deploy
- You define the bounty terms
- You choose when to promote to production
- The DAO provides oversight to prevent abuse

## The Protocol Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Contracts">
    Deploy your audited contracts via `BattleChainDeployer`. This automatically registers them with the `AttackRegistry`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Safe Harbor Agreement">
    Use `AgreementFactory` to create an agreement defining your bounty terms, scope, and contact details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adopt the Agreement">
    Call `adoptSafeHarbor()` on the registry to link your protocol to the agreement.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Attack Mode">
    Call `requestUnderAttack()` to submit your contracts for DAO review.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Approval">
    The DAO reviews your request to ensure it's not a mainnet copycat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stress Test Period">
    Once approved, whitehats can legally attack your contracts. Monitor for issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Promote to Production">
    When confident, call `promote()`. After a 3-day delay, your contracts enter production mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll Need

Before starting, ensure you have:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Audited Contracts" icon="file-code">
    Your contracts should be audited before deploying to BattleChain. This is a stress test, not a replacement for audits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Liquidity" icon="coins">
    Real funds to deploy with your contracts. Start with an amount you're comfortable losing during testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recovery Address" icon="vault">
    A secure address where whitehats will send recovered funds (minus their bounty).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Contact Details" icon="address-book">
    Emergency contacts so whitehats can pre-notify you before disclosing issues.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

```solidity
// 1. Deploy via BattleChainDeployer
address myContract = battleChainDeployer.deployCreate2(salt, bytecode);

// 2. Create agreement
address agreement = agreementFactory.create(details, owner, salt);

// 3. Adopt the agreement
safeHarborRegistry.adoptSafeHarbor(agreement);

// 4. If deployer is different from agreement owner, authorize the owner
attackRegistry.authorizeAgreementOwner(myContract, agreementOwner);

// 5. Request attack mode
attackRegistry.requestUnderAttack(agreement);

// 6. After stress testing, promote to production
attackRegistry.promote(agreement);
```
