Follow these best practices to maximize the value of stress testing on BattleChain.

## Deployment Best Practices

### Use Identical Code

Deploy the exact same bytecode to BattleChain that you'll deploy to mainnet. The only differences should be:

- Constructor parameters (addresses, chain IDs)
- Configuration values that legitimately differ per-chain

```solidity
// Good: Same contract, different config
MyVault vault = new MyVault(
    battleChainOracleAddress,  // Different oracle per chain
    chainSpecificFee           // Different fee per chain
);

// Bad: Different code for BattleChain
MyVault vault = new MyVaultTestVersion();  // Don't do this
```

### Start with Reasonable Liquidity

Deploy enough liquidity to attract whitehats, but not so much that you're uncomfortable losing it all:

| Protocol Type | Suggested Starting Liquidity |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| DEX/AMM | $50K - $200K |
| Lending | $100K - $500K |
| Yield Aggregator | $50K - $150K |
| NFT/Gaming | $10K - $50K |

<Note>
You can always add more liquidity after initial deployment if you want to attract more testing.
</Note>

### Complete Audit First

BattleChain is for stress testing, not finding obvious bugs. Complete your audit before deploying:

```
Audit Complete → Deploy to BattleChain → Stress Test → Deploy to Mainnet
```

## Agreement Best Practices

### Set Attractive Bounty Terms

Whitehats compare bounty terms across protocols. Competitive terms attract more testing:

```solidity
BountyTerms({
    bountyPercentage: 10,          // Industry standard is 10%
    bountyCapUsd: 5_000_000,       // $5M cap is attractive
    retainable: true,              // Easier for whitehats
    identity: IdentityRequirements.Anonymous,  // Lower barrier
    diligenceRequirements: "",
    aggregateBountyCapUsd: 0       // No aggregate limit
})
```

### Provide Clear Contact Details

Make it easy for whitehats to reach you:

```solidity
Contact[] contacts = new Contact[](3);
contacts[0] = Contact({ name: "Security Email", contact: "security@protocol.com" });
contacts[1] = Contact({ name: "Telegram", contact: "@protocol_security" });
contacts[2] = Contact({ name: "Discord", contact: "discord.gg/protocol #security" });
```

### Use a Secure Recovery Address

The asset recovery address receives rescued funds. Use:

- A multisig wallet
- An address you can monitor 24/7
- A cold wallet for large amounts

## Timing Best Practices

### Plan for Sufficient Testing Time

Don't rush to promotion. Recommended minimum times:

| Risk Level | Minimum Attack Period |
|------------|----------------------|
| Low (simple contracts) | 1-2 weeks |
| Medium (DeFi primitives) | 2-4 weeks |
| High (complex DeFi) | 4-8 weeks |

### Coordinate with Your Launch

```
Week 1-2: Deploy to BattleChain, request attack mode
Week 2-6: Stress testing period
Week 6: Promote to production
Week 7: Deploy to mainnet
```

### Avoid Promoting During Holidays

Whitehats are less active during holidays. Avoid promoting when fewer eyes are watching.

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Watch for Events

Monitor these events on your agreement:

```solidity
// State changes
event AgreementStateChanged(address indexed agreementAddress, ContractState newState);

// On your contracts, monitor for unusual activity
// Large transfers, unexpected function calls, etc.
```

### Set Up Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- Large fund movements
- State changes on your agreement
- Unusual transaction patterns
- Gas price spikes (may indicate MEV activity)

### Link BattleChain to Mainnet Monitoring

Consider triggering mainnet alerts based on BattleChain activity:

```
BattleChain exploit detected → Alert mainnet monitors → Review mainnet contracts
```

## Security Best Practices

### Don't Reveal Exploit Details Publicly

If you discover a vulnerability during testing, don't announce it publicly until mainnet contracts are safe.

### Maintain Operational Security

- Use hardware wallets for admin keys
- Implement timelocks on critical functions
- Have an incident response plan ready

### Document Everything

Keep records of:
- When you deployed
- What bounty terms you set
- Any issues reported
- How you responded

## After Promotion

### Keep BattleChain Updated

Your BattleChain deployment should mirror mainnet:

1. Deploy updates to BattleChain first (in attack mode)
2. Stress test the update
3. Promote when confident
4. Deploy the same update to mainnet

### Continue Monitoring

Even in production mode, monitor your BattleChain contracts. They're a canary for mainnet issues.

### Contribute to the Ecosystem

- Share (non-sensitive) learnings with the community
- Help improve BattleChain documentation
- Participate in DAO governance
